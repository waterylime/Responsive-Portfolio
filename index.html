      <p class="p2"> I am (dont ask thats rude) old. I have lived in Georgetown, Colorado my entier life. I am currently
        in the never ending process of home repairs (YA home ownership).
        I hope to retire or move to Tiipei, Taiwan. I have two dogs a mastiff named Deva and a cocker spaniel named Moco
        they are both spolied rotten, and beyond needy.
        Just to put it out there I am an introvert and an otaku, which explains my hobbies. In my free time I read, it
        is not uncommon for me to have multiple books from multiple
        series that I am currently reading going at once. I perfer to read Japanes light novels and manga but I also
        like syfi. My current obsession with books has my
        library at close to 10,000 books that includes both paper back, digital, and audio. When I am not reading I am
        watching anime, playing video games, cosplaying,
        and any random art projects. My current art projects is working on several pieces of embroidery for a quilt I am
        making. I can't tell you much if anything about
        curent popular TV show, but if you are interested in politics I am the person to go to. MSNBC, BBC News, and
        C-SPAN is what I binge. I enjoy taking walks, but I'm
        allergic to the sun so it's a bit of a pain. When I have money that I am not saving to go on trip's abroad I
        love to go see comedins live, the opera, plays
        (can't wait till I can get my paws on Hamilton tickets). Tho I live in Colorado i absolutely hate snow. </p>
